Hello doctor, I get a cough for the last few days, which is heavy during night times. No raise in temperature but feeling tired with no travel history. No contact with any Covid-19 persons. It has been four to five days and has drunk a lot of Benadryl and took Paracetamol too. Doctors have shut the OP so do not know what to do? Please help.
-
Hello, I understand your concern. I just have a few more questions.
Does your cough has phlegm? Any other symptoms like difficulty breathing? Any other medical condition such as asthma, hypertension? Are you a smoker? Alcoholic beverage drinker?
--
Thank you doctor,
I have phlegm but not a lot. A tiny amount comes out most of the time. I have no difficulty in breathing. No medical conditions and not a smoker nor a drinker.
-
Hi, I would recommend you take n-acetylcysteine 200 mg powder dissolved in water three times a day. You may also nebulize using PNSS (saline nebulizer) three times a day. This will help the phlegm to come out. I would also recommend you take vitamin C 500 mg and zinc to boost your immune system. If symptoms persist, worsen or new onset of symptoms has been noted, further consult is advised.

Hello doctor, I am suffering from coughing, throat infection from last week. At that time fever did not persist and also did not felt any chest pain. Two days later, I consulted with a doctor. He prescribed Cavidur 625, Montek LC, Ambrolite syrup and Betaline gargle solution. Since then throat infection improved and frequent cough also coming out. Coughing also improved remarkably though not completely. From yesterday onwards fever is occuring (maximum 100-degree Celcius). I have not come in touch with any foreign returned person nor went outside. In our state, there is no incidence of Covid-19. Please suggest what to do?
-
Hello, I can understand your concern.
In my opinion, you should get done a chest x-ray and CBC (complete blood count). If both these are normal then no need to worry much. I hope this helps.
--
Thank you doctor,
After doing all these I can upload all for further query.
-
Hi, yes, upload in this query only. I will see and revert to you.
--
Thank you doctor,
As per your guidelines, I have made one test. Due to city shutdown, I could not able to make an x-ray of chest. Fever is coming every 12 hours. But cough does not persist currently. The only problem is a fever. I am uploading the blood examination report. Please advice.
-
Hi, I can understand your concern. I have gone through the report you have attached. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).
Your total count is on the higher side of normal along with low hemoglobin. So start Azithromycin 500 mg 1-0-0, Tablet Dolo 650 1-0-1. Once your fever and cough subside, start an Iron tablet for low hemoglobin.
I hope this helps.
--
Thank you doctor,
How many tablets of Azithromycin to be taken? Is it in the morning? I want to make you know that I have already taken Azithromycin five days before. Should she start it? And also can I start an Iron tablet today itself?
-
Hi, Yes, you can take iron tablet from today onwards. And no need for Azithromycin now as you have already taken it. Drink plenty of fluids orally and keep yourself hydrated. Do warm water gargles and steam inhalation four to five times a day.

Hello doctor,
I am a 23-year-old man. I have anxiety and depression but no immunodeficiency disorders or chronic diseases. First, I wanna know if my immune system is weakened and how likely am I to die of Coronavirus.
Second, I have itchiness in my throat and shortness of breath. I always have it because of anxiety but now it is more persistent than before. I also feel a very subtle feeling of pain, burning sensation and itchiness in my chest. I did not go out during the past ten days and have not been in contact with someone with positive Covid. And I quit smoking past week. Down to one or zero cigarettes from 20 a day. Why am I feeling itchiness and pain and burning sensation? How likely am I to have Covid-19? And how likely am I to die from it?
-
Hello. Anxiety can manifest itself in physical or psychological symptoms or both. The irritation sensation you are experiencing is a part of your anxiety. Also please do not believe the hype about covid. It has a low mortality rate, of 2-3 percent, that too mortality is very high in people above 60-70 years with other co-morbidities. You do not have any such disorders and you have not even been in contact with anyone, so do not worry.
Please continue to take your medicines for anxiety if you are taking them, if not, please consider visiting a psychiatrist and get started on some low dose SSRI type of medicines. Also, if needed a low dose Benzodiazepines can be added temporarily. Also, please do some deep breathing exercises, or progressive muscle relaxation. You can also take some honey with water to reduce the itching in the throat and also try doing some gargles with lukewarm salt water.

Hello doctor,
Last night I was getting chills, feeling more cold than usual and lightheaded and a lot of burping. Maybe like every 30 minutes or less or so feel more chills running down my body and chest feeling bit weird like I am starting having trouble breathing then goes back to normal and repeats, with weird feeling like chills down my left and right lungs or left and right upper chest. Also, my heart was pumping fast. Also, some minor coughs were there since seven days ago, still here. I have white mucus and have not gotten yellow yet.
I took medicines yesterday but today I got severe cold and flu medicine with a pain reliever, the chills did not go away. Then today, I called the doctor on the phone and told him what happen last night and the same thing happened this morning too. I had minor coughs, feeling lightheaded, feel like maybe cannot breathe or something, and a lot of burping. I told him the burping issue was going on for at least two years, but somehow this time I am feeling lightheaded. He just gives Pepcid, a try maybe GERD. I ate that today still feeling chills now and still burping a lot.
Right now, still some chills on arms, with breathing issue or something makes my chest feel weird and arm sometimes. So, should I be worried? I do not think I have a fever now but do not feel hot on the forehead? Was it GERD or flu, it is Coronavirus or something else? I hope it is not Coronavirus.
I am 21 years old and weigh around 110-115 kg.

Hello,
please answer the following:
Any travel history in the last one month? Any use of airports? Any fever, have you checked the temperature? Any cough? Any mucus or phlegm? How is your sleep? Is there any malaise or body aches or weakness?
--
Thank you doctor,
I travel to school, nearby grocery stores in the bus. No airport exposure. I have not checked the temperature. I do not feel hot or anything. I have minor coughs and sore throat. Yes, I have mucus which seems white or clear for now.
During sleep, I do not have much aches. Last night I have not got much sleep, probably because I was thinking about stuff being worried, but got some sleep though.
-
Hi, most probably with the history it does not appear like a severe problem or Coronavirus infection. Is sore throat severe and does the pain last the whole day? Do you smoke or drink?
Can you try taking Sudafed, Tylenol, and Zyrtec and try getting sleep for a few days? I am sure that will make you feel better.
Avoid exposure to smoke dust and cold winds. Keep the AC to a minimum or use ceiling fan instead. Drink plenty of water and warm fluids. Avoid eating out, partying. Avoid unnecessary travel.
You need not quarantine yourself in the strictest manner but some amount of restrictions in interacting and meeting with the community is advised.
Lastly, where are you currently? Your place of residence and country? Is it a Corona endemic country? Did you talk to or interact with any known or suspected flu patient?
Can you please take a picture of the back of the throat with open mouth showing details of the tonsils and pharyngeal wall and send it to me?
--
Thank you doctor,
I woke up this morning, I had trouble sleeping being worried, but I got some sleep then nearby phone ringing woke me up.
So far, seems no one got any severe coughs or pain so far. I only hear minor coughs the past week or so. Thanks for those medicine recommendations for sleep. I fall asleep quicker, usually, it takes me around one hour to fall asleep on most days.
I will try to avoid smoking as much as possible. Yes, I will be staying inside since many places are on lockdown. And school is online. I recently turned on the air purifier to clean up some air for allergies possible viruses but makes me cold. I might not need AC unless really hot.
I will be staying home for the next month at least. My chills right now are feeling a bit better, but a little sick only because maybe I did not get enough sleep.
I stay in San Francisco CA, United States, and there are close to 40 confirmed cases around here. No severe reports near my district, and have not heard anyone in serious condition.
So, last week I have a sore throat and tonsil pain while swallowing for a few days, then one day drank a lot of honey and water and some tea, then it got better. Not sure if it got smaller, but the pain was less now though. Between my tonsils in the middle (behind the tongue) looks like my throat, got some red stuff, maybe looks like inflamed or rashes. Any recommendations? Any foods or drinks that can help?
-
Hi, you have got it right. Follow all the precautions. You will be alright soon. Try getting a good sleep tonight.
I heard about the cases in SF. My brother was supposed to fly there from India for work but his meeting got canceled in the wake of the virus.
Yes, your camera has not done a decent job this time around. It has not focussed on our area of interest. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). But yours has picked up the two big bumps in the back of the throat (enlarged tonsils).
The tonsils could be enlarged due to the current infection and sore throat problem you are having. Once the problem is resolved they should get back to their normal size, which I guess, in you, must be slightly big. The pharyngeal wall between the tonsils could be having some granular bumps which are quite common during an infection.
Now you do not worry, for most such infections are due to viruses (not Corona). They usually get better with time and supportive treatment. Traditional Indian forms of medicine advise honey and hot water. Tea makes a good addition I guess. Sudafed and Zyrtec appropriate for your weight will help additionally. Tylenol every time you got pain will help you tide over this period wonderfully.
Now watch for some warning symptoms fever, increased pain, thick mucus, thick postnasal drip, severe malaise, swelling in the neck, etc. In such cases promptly revert to me. You may need a Z pack then.

Thank you doctor,
As of now 12:40 PM I am breathing harder than usual since 30 minutes ago. I only ate some breakfast and drank water.
Here is my story: Before Feb 28th - no issues at all, besides always burping a lot, sometimes bloating, no coughs, tonsil was enlarged for a while, no lightheadedness, no breathing problems, not sick.
Friday February 28th - I woke up feeling unwell, drank water went back to bed, came back out super lightheaded about to faint, lied on bed for an hour, came out stomach feeling weird, even more lightheaded about to faint, can barely even eat a little noodles and two small pieces of spam, vomited it, then four more times which as water or acid. Hours later was better.
Saturday February 29th - diarrhea
Sunday March 1st - diarrhea
Monday March 2 - diarrhea
Tuesday March 3 - diarrhea
Wednesday March 4 - No stool
Thursday March 3 - No more diarrhea
Friday March 4th - Monday March 9th - no issues
Monday March 9th - feeling better, no problems, enlarged tonsil, no coughs really.
Sunday march 15 - no problems besides burping, minor coughs, some sore throat
Afternoon I ate chicken, burping a lot, stomach uncomfortable, felt like breathing problems, chills on hands, chest and left and right side, felt like could not breathe. 20 minutes later, still chills breathing a bit better, lightheaded kind of feel like fainting, then went to bed for 15 minutes (the breathing problem and weird chest feeling comes back randomly), ate tums, then later I drank cough and flu medicine.
On Monday march 16 - woke up around 11:30 AM, feeling breathing problems, chills around body, lightheaded again, chest feeling weird, burping a lot, and I described my story to doctor he said it sounds like you ate something bad, does sound like GERD, of course we do not know for sure unless lab tests maybe on stool. He asked have you tried stronger antacids like Pepcid or Zantac?
I said no. Then doctor asked me to try Pepcid and tell me how it goes.
Tuesday and Wednesday March 16/17 - feeling better, no lightheadedness, no more chills, minor coughs, sore throat, burping a lot, no breathing problems so far. Pepcid no problems so far besides making me burp almost all day.
Wednesday night still coughing a lot and drank severe cold and flu medicine.
Thursday march 21 I woke up fine, then once ate Pepcid and drank some water, heart rate was going really fast, started to make worried, called doctor office they said can you count your beats per minute, then I counted, my phone was showing my heart rating going to 120 bpm, when I counted to them was not 120 bpm, then they told me to call back if it gets worse. Then shortly after, I drank some water and ate a little bit of breakfast. My heart rate started to drop slowly and was getting better after that.
Friday march 20- 10 AM I woke up with some chest pains (chest area above the stomach), then some coughing and feeling a little sick, little lightheaded, heart beating fast, breathing harder, felt of shortness of breath. Drank some water and breathe harder, a little bit of mucus.
15-20 minutes later no more chest pains, still breathing harder.
11 AM - still breathing a little bit harder than usual, coughing would make me breathe even harder. Better now, but still breathing a little harder than usual.
11:30 AM moving makes me breathe harder, sat in bed.
11:58 AM - feeling a bit better
12:10 - feeling like breathing a harder than usual.
After an hour later, feeling better now which is strange. Not sure if its heart problems, acid reflux, chest issues, or esophagus.
-
Hello, always Protonix is better than Zantac. Try using Protonix (Pantoprazole). Do not lie down immediately after consuming meals. Do not drink a lot of water after a meal. Avoid spicy and oily foods.
--
Thank you doctor,
I went to the store to look for Zantac they did not have it, so I talked to the pharmacy they said sounds like could be some weird chest tightening and the doctor said since Pepcid and Zantac are the same. He said to try Ranitidine.
Right now I tried Pepcid again like now, for the first five to ten minutes I think it means me feel more nervous or anxiety or something, I tried to calm myself by putting fingers on teeth. Then I think now it did not cause my heart to beat super fast this time which was strange. Even water makes my heart beat a little faster. Should I stick with Pepcid? Finish the entire bottle? I think it has 20-30 pieces.
I used to lie down after a meal a few years ago like I get hungry before I go to bed then I started eating snacks and lying down. Sometimes I starve myself. Sometimes I wake up with acid feeling in my mouth.
I don't know why I woke up this morning with chest pain, like the middle area right above the stomach and felt like I had breathing problems, breathing harder than usual, drank water and barely could eat breakfast (lasted for at least 30 minutes+). I then waited a bit after 10 minutes, drank hot water and ate breakfast, I started to breathe better again.
Could it be shortness or breath? May be blood pressure? Esophagus issue? Chest issue? Heart issue? I am having weird breathing. Should I be worried?
-
Hi, you need to take Pantoprazole or any other proton pump inhibitor. Avoid heavy meals. The issue appears like a heartburn problem due to acidity only. It does not appear sinister.
--
Thank you doctor,
I was trying to finish the bowl of food in one hour. I was eating veggies and rice, halfway through felt something like acid may be some pain in chest and throat. Feeling lightheaded so ate some meat to then coughed after.
-
Hi, do not worry about it. Drink plenty of water but not immediately after a meal. Eat well cooked meats.
--
Thank you doctor, 
I really appreciate your help so much. I appreciate your time and effort to help me and give advice. Only thing I am worried is just the chest pains, breathing issues and esophagus and throat stuff. I will try to wait two to three hours after eating or drinking before bed now. I hope to get less chest issues when I wake up.
-
Hi, do not worry so much. You will be absolutely alright. Give it some time. If you are not getting better we can do laryngoscopy and check if there is anything wrong with the larynx. Do you eat healthy food and do exercises?
--
Yeah if it doesn't get better Laryngoscopy would be perfect. Okay, I'll give it some time Thank you!
I try to eat vegetables and fruits. I don't eat much junk food that much. I used to eat more junk years ago, but now mostly vegetables, fruits, meat (pork, chicken, beef, fish) usually not fried, and tried to eat whole wheat bread with fried chicken patty from the super market (for school lunch) since its cheap and its chicken (stopped now after acid problems), don't really eat french fries, pizza or drink soda etc...
Exercise, haven't been exercising these few months. I have been telling myself that, but then i haven't really been doing it. Used to a lot years ago, now barely.
Since high school, when i exercise running when i try to get air feels like throat is tight or chest is tight and air is trying to squeeze its way through. After this point High school until college feels like i'm not breathing enough air. When i was younger (Elementary/middle school) felt like i gotten a lot more air then now through my throat and air doesn't squeezes through.
One doctor just used stethoscope for heart and lungs, told me to breathe hasn't said much about it. Then another doctor said, sounds you are not breathing that much, feels like not getting another air (in high school, like 4-6 years ago maybe), they didn't do much about it.
So, when i try to breath regularly, seems like not much air comes out through mouth even before acid reflux,.That's why recent breathing problems kinda worry me, but anyways yeah like that.
-
I guess you are in the right track. With regards to food diet and exercise.
Restart doing your exercise. Keep yourself active. Try having more than three meals a day but keep the quantity of each meal less than the usual. That way you eat more frequently but without putting weight or adding unnecessary calories.
--
Sounds good! Awesome! Appreciate your time and effort to help, this means a lot. Very patient and kind!

Hi, I am Chaitanya, 27 years old. I use to swim daily in morning. Does COVID-19 spreads through water ? What precautions should I take to avoid infection?
-
Hello and welcome to Ask A Doctor service.
I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.
First few cases were suspected to have spread from food. However human to human spread is mainly from air droplets.
I would suggest you to refrain from swimming for sometime. Although the virus will get killed in swimming pool if it doesnot find host for more than few minutes.
Other precautions include to avoid social gatherings, wash hands frequently with soap and water, cover face with mask, stay home during sickness, avoid travel.
Hope it helps. Let me know if I can assist you further.

What is the treatment for Covid-19?
-
Depends on severity. COVID-19 pandemic at this time, so a doctor on video may consult by video instead of requiring an in-person visit. Flu-like symptoms can be from a strep throat infection, a cold or influenza, or from some other cause like COVID-19. Usually, a person calls the doctor if the symptoms are bothersome, serious, recurrent, or persistent. COVID-19 testing depends on local availability.

--
Criteria for COVID test?
-
Real vs. textbook. Real-life criteria is different because we don't have enough tests, supplies, or medical staff around the world at this time (March 2020). Textbook criteria are suspected COVID in hospitalized persons or in those with underlying medical conditions; or persons who got symptoms less than 14 days after (1) contact with a suspect or confirmed COVID patient or (2) travel through high-risk COVID area.
--
I have covid 19 symptoms?
-
Without any details it's impossible to say.
--
Do I have covid 19?
-
Without any details it's impossible to say.

--
Is vomiting and diarrhea a symptom of covid-19?
-
COVID-19 symptoms. Nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea occur fairly frequently early in the infection, but are rarely if ever the only symptoms. If cough and fever don't develop within a day or two after vomiting or diarrhea, probably it isn't COVID-19.

--
Anxiety because of the covid 19 news?
-
Break. At 39 your risk for severe infections is very low. A strategy that I recommend is taking in information daily, but get away from it. Practice prudent precautions. In my off times away from ER (still practicing front line ER) I focus my mind on my cooking, planning my garden, engage with my friends and loved ones and read. 

--
Is the coronavirus 229E the same as covid-19?
-
CoV229e is one of several coronaviruses that cause common colds. Biologically related to SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19), but different viruses.

--
Can I get a covid 19 test?
-
Seek care right away if difficulty breathing, other severe symptoms.
Seek testing if sick, PLUS known Covid-19 contact, or travel to high risk country, or been in facility treating people with Covid-19, or severe pneumonia of unknown cause. Call 0800 029 999 for test. If sick or possibly exposed (not both), stay home. Seek consultation if sick. If known exposure & not sick, self-isolate 14 days.

--
Where can I be tested for covid 19?
-
your local doctor, local health department, we have no idea here what your set up is where you live.

--
Am I at risk for COVID-19 in the United States?
-
COVID infections will likely pick up over the next few weeks in US. Avoiding travel and following hand washing recommendations are probably the most important prophylactic measures.

--
My dad last week was vomiting and had diarrhea now this week it has turned into runny nose and a cough...no fever....any chance it’s Covid-19?
-
Symptoms of COVID-19 are usually the same as a cold or the flu, with diarrhea being uncommon.
The COVID-19 infection is worldwide. The goal is to keep people separated so that the clinics and hospitals are not overwhelmed. Patients with medical symptoms should see their primary care doctor on VIDEO or by PHONE, and get instructed to go to a clinic or ER only if not treatable by video or phone.

--
11 year old has a cough, runny nose, headache,earache, no fever. Is this COVID-19?
-
The symptom pattern is not specific to one agent.
It suggests a cold and ear infection. Kids have been among those least affected by Covid-19 . Only proper screening and testing could confirm or exclude this or any other agent. Parainfluenza, rhinovirus, or RSV would be more likely.

--
I am getting headache at night. Been battling with a sore throat and post nasal drip. No fever. Cough only slightly at times. I went for laproscope and removal of my fallopian tubes on 2nd March. All this started after that. Must i test for covid 1o?
-
In brief: Unlikely
Not at this point.
Treat what you have currently symptomatically. Stock up now whilst not yet on lockdown. I don't feel that you qualify for a Covid test right now. Keep posting your questions.

--
True or false? Anyone infected with COVID-19 start have diarrhea and increases the chances of death compared to person who just start respiratory symptoms, why?
-
In brief: Data
From Data from China there has been association between worse infection and diarrhea.
The seems to be a worse inflammatory response associated with people who have diarrhea.

--
Do people with the Covid coronavirus get any diarrhea? If yes, how bad is the diarrhea, and what portion of infected people start having diarrhea?
-
In brief: Respiratory illness
Cough, fever and shortness of breath are most common sx's.
Per Clinical Characteristics of 138 Hospitalized Patients With 2019 Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia in Wuhan, China - JAMA, Wang et al., February 7, 2020 - about 10% of hospitalized patient had diarrhea. This study only looked at people who were so sick that they had to be hospitalized. This is a small study number.
-
In brief: No
To date the process has been a respiratory virus.
No gut issues (diarrhea,etc.) are reported so far as part of the symptom pattern.

--
Can Covid-19 be transmitted sexually? Can any coronavirus be transmitted sexually?
-
In brief: Sort of
If you are having sex with someone who has Covid-19 you are quite at risk of getting it.
High likelihood if kissing and having intercourse but it may not be transmitted through intercourse but the closeness in an intimate situation like that with someone who is infected gives a high likelihood of transmission.

--
Should I shave my beard to reduce my chances of contracting coronavirus / covid-19?
-
In brief: Yes
This virus clings to everything especially hairs.
Either wash your beard a few times a day and spray with alcohol or shave off.

--
I have mild asthma which is well controlled if I were to contract Covid 19 would I experience any difficulties as can’t seem to find much information on asthma patients who have had the Coronavirus many thanks ?
-
In brief: COVID-19 and Asthma
Great question. Yes asthma is a chronic lung disease which carries some increased risk with COVID-19.
Good asthma control along with good handwashwng, social distancing avoiding unnecessary travel along with your young age should keep your risk of complications low. Smoking, hypertension, diabetes, obesity or compromised immune system are also risk factors to be considered.

--
Is mild intermittent asthma an elevated risk group for Covid 19 complications? If so, should I continue to use my inhalers when it's occasionally necessary or will the steroids in them put me at more risk? Thank you.
-
In brief: Maybe
Being over 50 with a medical condition like intermittent asthma makes you at higher risk for any respiratory illness including COVID19.
It appears to be less an issue for children and youth.

--
I read that people taking steroids for asthma are at higher risk for poor outcomes from COVID19. Does this include inhalers containing steroids? Also, is mild intermittent asthma a risk for poor outcomes or only more severe forms of asthma? Thanks
-
In brief: Not quite that way
People with chronic lung problems do worse in a lung disease outbreak.
For one specific person... well, there's no way to guess. "People" in general do worse if they have UNcontrolled lung disease. That means it's likely that asthmatics using inhaled steroids to give them good disease control will be BETTER OFF than asthmatics who use steroids but still cannot get good control. Be in good control.

--
What symptoms would make you think I do not have COVID-19. I have a bad cold, but got diarrhea twice, so does diarrhea mean it is not COVID?
-
In brief: No
Diarrhea does not rule out COVID.
If you have traveled to endemic areas or met with people that traveled there, you should test if possible.

--
Can Covid-19 be transmitted sexually? Can any coronavirus be transmitted sexually?
-

--
Have read COVID-19 news quoting some experts as saying that we will see more confirmed cases as more tests are performed, but the mortality rate should drop as that happens. Any sign of that yet?
-
In brief: COVID-19 mortality
Don't confuse actual mortality rate with REPORTED rate.
The actual rate probably will remain stable (and likely lower in the US than some other countries, because of sophisticated intensive medical care). But as testing expands and more people with mild symptoms (or no symptoms) are diagnosed, reported mortality will decline; likely happening now, but it may take weeks for data to be known.

--
I travelled to Austria on 25 Jan 2020 and returned on 31Jan 2020. My trip included a stopover in Munich. I currently do not show any symptoms listed for coronavirus. Should i get lab tested as a precaution and will this test be covered by the medical?
-
In brief: Hard to say
The questions you pose are more appropriate to ask your local physicians and health plans.
As a USA based site we have no access to or information about the changing local recommendations for world travel around the globe nor would we know what your plan covers. Find a local health contact & contact your health plan for guidance.

For students in dorms living with students from many countries, what extra additional precautions do they need to prevent catching novel coronavirus?
-
In brief: Standard precautions
COVID-19 is now official name for the illness caused by the newly discovered coronavirus (COronaVirus Infectious Disease - 2019).
So far it is extremely rare in the US (2/12/20). Until and unless COVID-19 becomes common no special precautions are necessary. In any dormitory or group living situation people with respiratory symptoms (colds, flu, etc.) should cover their coughs and wash hands frequently.

--
Can taking extra vitamin C every day help prevent you from catching the coronavirus or the flu? If so, how much vitamin C is recommended?
-
In brief: Vitamin C
While getting enough vitamin C in your diet is highly recommended, it has no special ability to prevent coronavirus or flu virus.
Best preventative measures for these are frequent handwashing and avoiding people with sneezing/coughing/cold symptoms and fevers.


--
Can taking extra steps for self-care (like staying hydrated, getting more sleep) every day help prevent you from catching the coronavirus or the flu?
-
In brief: Yes
It helps to keep the body in good shape and good nutrition.

Last tuesday I had a flu shot and a neumonia shot. I am 68 and male. I had a very sore arm and felt bad the next day in which I had blood drawn for a test. The results showed a high white cell blood count as well as high ANC and AMC. Could these high readings be because of the shots the day before?
-
Hello,
 * The pneumonia shot per se is not responsible for high WBC count, but as you are telling there are soreness and bad feeling at the injection site over arm, there are all possibilities that you have cellulitis or possible abscess formation at the injection site; which will recruit neutrophils at the site and cause secondary rise in WBC count.
 * Primary relief with ice application and secondary management with systemic antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medicines with your doc.
 Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
 Take care

My father recently passed over the weekend. His body was fighting an infection along with pneumonia for 1 week. During that time, he would urinate bloody urine into the foley. The doctors said that was completely normal. It was very dark red. Is that normal?
-
Hello,
 * The pneumonia does not give rise to red urine called hematuria.
* There can be possible causes for red blood cells in the urine as
 - uncontrolled urinary tract infection
- kidney damage via systemic sepsis
- abnormal clotting factors or platelet function
- side effects of drugs
- dehydration related
- secondary effects of diabetes
- others
 * Kindly share all reports if available with you for further discussion ahead and guide in details.
 Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
 Take care

Hi, my name is XXXX. My grandfather is suffering from pneumonia right now and refuses to go to the doctor because of the price needed to obtain a patented medicine. In Indonesia, it is not hard to find these kinds of doctors that don t want to help people in need. What medicine can you guys recommend for a home treatment?

I ve been diagnosed with pneumonia (I am 63) on Monday evening. My daughter (31) is exhibiting the same symptoms - went to her doctor and currently taking Z-Pak. I was prescribed azithromysin 500 mg for 5 days. I was concerned since we were experiencing the same symptoms. We spend time together but she is married and lives in town. I am married and my husband is not experiencing any symptoms. Totally confused. Is there a way to know if you have a viral or bacterial pneumonia. I have had all kinds of different blood work done, chest x-ray, - can they tell? How long is pneumonia contagious? She has 2 children and we re trying to figure out if it s okay to have someone else watch the kids. They are not sick at this time.

Hello,
 Usually, he is contagious one week before treatment and until three days after treatment.

My 19 year old son was diagnosed with pneumonia 5 months ago and was given antibiotics but with minimal results. Unfortunately he still suffers from the same symptoms but since he is in the military he refuses to go back to the doctor for fear of reprisal. His cough is still deep and his energy is low. Are there any long term repercussions for his lungs if he continues without treatment.

Hi, I m a 55 yr old white female, 5`4 , 180 lbs. I had childhood asthma and bronchitis, and were given steroids frequently. I seemed to grow out of it at age 17. During the last 14 yrs I ve developed Fibromyalgia/Chronic Fatigue, RA, for 14 months my SED rate stayed at 53-108 and they could not find out why, Cushing s Syndrome, neuropathy of the feet, and most importantly - Hypogammagobulinemia. I rec d IGG iv s monthly for 4 yrs, then lost insurance 6 yrs. ago. I m disabled and on Medicare, I haven t rec d IV s in 6 yrs. During that time I ve had pneumonia 17 times, once was septic pneumonia, constant sinus problems, PCP infection and a rare form of arthritis associated with the hypo (the Dr. couldn t tell me the name of it). I have contacted Medicare, foundations and pharm companies trying to get help to start treatment again. Reaching out to any possible help has been met with apathy and no one would try to point me in the right direction. I m really worried and would like to know my chances of surviving if I can t get the IGG treatments. Thank you very much for your time.

Hello,
 The cause of chronic pneumonia is mandatory to be evaluated here with culture of bronchial lavage fluid, CT scan of the thorax and other supportive evaluations.
 Unless the root cause is identified, one cannot get the complete management chart.
 Hope I have answered your query. Feel free to post further doubts.
 Thank you.

The reading of my chest x-ray states that there are hazed and confluent densities seen in the left upper lung field. The rest of the lungs are clear. The heart is not enlarged. The rest of the included structures are unremarkable. I am very much worried because the impression states that I have MINIMAL PTB, LEFT WITH PNEUMONIA. Please advice me on what to do best as I fear this might affect my application for renewal of contract.

I was given amoxycillin for a chest infection and did not improve after 48 hours, therefore I went back to the GP who then gave me Clarythmomycin as it resulted in pneumonia. I have been off work for 3 weeks now and feel completely washed out and exhausted. I had a chest x-ray which was clear, but was given an inhaler temporarily as I was out of breath and wheezy. I still have an incredible amount of phlegm which has now changed from brown to sometimes green to clear. Unfortunately, for last 3 days, my trachea is extremely bruised to touch and feel as if someone is pressing my windpipe. Although my tonsils aren t swollen, my ear hurts deep inside. I have had to start taking paracetamol again this week as feel weak, wobbly and feel as if I am going backwards again instead of improving. I am 45 years old. Non-smoker.This is the 3rd time I have had pneumonia in 18 years. I am reasonably fit and healthy, and I don t suffer from colds normally, but whenever I come down with something, I seem to suffer with it. How long does it take to get back to normal? Are the trachea symptoms part of the initial pneumonia symptoms or would I need to see the GP again. I am feeling extremely fed up of generally feeling unwell. I am taking a tonic (Metatone) and drinking and eating healthily. Basically, is it normal to feel this unwell for so long.

Hi,
 Yes, it might be that after the pneumonia the recovery time lasts up to one week however I recommend you to do a chest CT to see if the pneumonia has gone completely.

I was diagnosed with pneumonia and pleurisy Friday 6/22/18.  Dr gave me Azithromiacin and 800mg of ibuprofen .  That was 4 days ago.  Azithromiacin has one pill left, and i no longer take the ibuprofen as not needed.  To date, I take Sudafed PE and Robitussin DM with expectorant & suppressant.  Every 4 hours when the meds wear off, my fever returns with body aches, chills, headache, and coughing. I continually cough up flem, and when lying down need to clear my throat every 30 seconds. I'm also bloated and get air bubbles under my ribs that are painful.

Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.
 * As far as my clinical experience is concerned, the intensity of the symptoms are not under control with oral antibiotics.
* In our clinic, I recommend the patient to get hospital admission, start intravenous antibiotics, broncho dilators and other supportive measures to control the same. Do give me further chance to assist in future.

I ve had symptoms of cough, headache, stuffy nose, fatigue, and sore throat for 4 days. I know these are typical of common cold. However, once before (18 months ago), when I just tried to ride it out, I developed pneumonia and was in hospital for several days. Are there any precautions I can take now to prevent this from getting complicated? Thanks.
-
Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. 
I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.
 Yes, you are right. If you don't pay attention in common cold, it can complicate as pneumonia. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief in common cold. 
1. Drink plenty of fluids orally and keep yourself hydrated.
2. Do warm water gargles and steam inhalation 4-5 times a day.
3. Avoid cold foods like ice cream, cold drinks etc.
4. Take treatment for common cold regularly.
5. Watch for persistent fever, chest pain, Yellowish green expectoration, breathing difficulty etc. If any of these symptom appears then immediately get done chest x ray.
6. Avoid smoking and alcohol if you have these habits.
 Hope I have answered your query.

My sister, age 72, and living alone drove herself to an emergency room at 4:00 a.m. with temperature of 101+, chills and a little dizziness. They diagnosed her with pneumonia. She has COPD and uses inhalers and oral meds. I am concerned because she just told me she is extremely tired and has been under a lot of stress due to move from home of 45+ years, family concerns and loss of husband 2 years ago. She had hip replacement three months ago. I live an hour and a half away and am wondering if I should drive to her city and check on her. She does have a son and a neighbor friend looking in on her.
-
Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.
 She is already suffering from COPD (chronic obstructive Pulmonary disease). And pneumonia can be severe in already compromised lungs. So pneumonia in COPD patients should be treated promptly. And hence she needs hospital admission, Intravenous antibiotics, anti pyretic, Intravenous fluids and other supportive drugs. So better to admit her and start appropriate treatment.
 Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
